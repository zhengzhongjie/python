"""
sockets for cross-task communication: start threads to communicate over sockets;
independent programs can too, because sockets are system-wide, much like fifos;
see the GUI and Internet parts of the book for more realistic socket use cases;
some socket servers my also need to talk to clients in threads or processes;
sockets pass byte strings, but can bu pickled objects or encoded Unicode text;
caveat:prints in threads may need to be synchronized if their  output ovderlaps;
